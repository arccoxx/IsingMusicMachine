# Ising Machine Simulator: Audio Annealing with Coupled Oscillators

Synthesize your own Ising sounds here... just run the script:) https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xZ21S309-ecghKHOOkeCW06vhPB-BRMO?usp=sharing

## Overview
This project simulates an **Ising machine**â€”a specialized computer for solving optimization problems inspired by magnetic spinsâ€”using coupled oscillators in Python. By mapping Ising spins to audio oscillators, we turn the simulation into a **sound synthesizer**. As the system "anneals" (cools down from chaos to order), it generates evolving soundscapes, like a cinematic THX-inspired swell: starting as rumbling noise and building to harmonic drones. It's not just computationâ€”it's audible art!

Run the code on Google Colab or locally to hear the machine "think" while solving Ising problems. Scale up oscillators for richer, cooler sounds.

## What is an Ising Machine?
The **Ising model** is a physics-inspired framework from statistical mechanics, modeling magnetism in materials. It consists of:

- **Spins**: Binary variables (e.g., +1 or -1, like magnetic poles "up" or "down") arranged on a lattice.
- **Couplings (J_ij)**: Interactions between spins. Positive J encourages alignment (ferromagnetic), negative J encourages opposition (antiferromagnetic).
- **Biases (h_i)**: External fields biasing individual spins.
- **Energy (Hamiltonian)**: The system's total energy is minimized when spins align to satisfy couplings:  
  \[ H = -\sum_{i<j} J_{ij} s_i s_j - \sum_i h_i s_i \]  
  The goal: Find the spin configuration with the lowest energy.

An **Ising machine** is hardware/software that solves this by physically or virtually evolving the system toward low-energy states. It's great for NP-hard optimization problems (e.g., graph partitioning, MAX-CUT) mapped to Ising form. Techniques like **simulated annealing** mimic cooling: Start "hot" (random flips) and cool to settle into optima.

## Simulating Ising Machines with a Synthesizer
We simulate the Ising model using the **Kuramoto model** of coupled oscillators (like synchronized fireflies or pendulums). This turns computation into sound generation:

- **Spins â†’ Oscillators**: Each spin is an audio oscillator with phase Î¸_i. Phases cluster to represent spin states: Synced phases = same spin (+1/+1); anti-synced (Ï€ apart) = opposite (+1/-1).
- **Couplings (J_ij) â†’ Coupling Strengths (K_ij)**: Positive K syncs oscillators (ferro), negative K anti-syncs (anti-ferro).
- **Lattice â†’ Network**: Oscillators connect via a matrix, like a modular synth patchbay.
- **Annealing â†’ Dynamics**: Add decreasing noise to mimic temperature drop. Oscillators evolve via:  
  \[ \dot{\theta_i} = \omega_i + \sum_j K_{ij} \sin(\theta_j - \theta_i) + \eta(t) \]  
  (Ï‰_i: natural frequency; Î·: noise).
- **Sound Output**: Sum oscillator waveforms (e.g., sin(Î¸(t))). Chaos (high noise) sounds noisy/dissonant; order (low noise) sounds harmonic/stable.

This is like a virtual modular synthesizer (e.g., VCV Rack) where CV (control voltage) represents couplings, and noise injects "temperature." The result: An audible analog computer!

## How This Project Works
This Python script uses NumPy for simulation and SciPy for audio output. It:
1. Defines oscillators with initial frequencies and random phases.
2. Sets a coupling matrix for an Ising problem (e.g., random or custom graph).
3. Simulates dynamics with decreasing noise (annealing) and optional glissando (rising pitches) for THX-like effects.
4. Generates a WAV file of the summed waveforms, capturing the annealing process.
5. Infers final spins from phases and computes energy to "solve" the problem.

Key features:
- Scalable: Increase N (oscillators) for denser sounds (e.g., N=30 for THX depth).
- Customizable: Tweak frequencies, couplings, duration, or add crescendo for drama.
- No external deps beyond Colab defaults (NumPy, SciPy, IPython).

The audio isn't just a byproductâ€”it's the machine's "voice" during computation, turning math into music.

## How to Use Ising Machines to Solve Problems
Ising machines excel at combinatorial optimization. Map your problem to spins/couplings, then anneal:

1. **Formulate**: Encode variables as spins. E.g., for MAX-CUT (partition graph to maximize cut edges): Spins = partitions, J_ij = -edge weights (anti-ferro encourages cuts).
2. **Simulate/Anneal**: Run dynamics to find low-energy states.
3. **Read Solution**: Extract spins from final configuration.

Examples:
- **Traveling Salesman**: Map cities to spins, couplings to distances.
- **Protein Folding**: Spins as amino acid orientations.
- **Scheduling**: Assign tasks with conflict penalties.

In this project, we solve random or small custom Ising instances (e.g., frustrated triangles). For real hardware, see D-Wave or Fujitsu's digital annealers. Here, it's educational and sonic!

## The Really Cool Fun Sound: Recording the Annealing
The magic is the audio! As the machine anneals:
- **High "Temperature" (Start)**: High noise â†’ Chaotic, rumbling dissonance (like static or alien whispers).
- **Critical Phase**: Noise drops â†’ Emerging patterns, self-organizing clusters (swelling textures, metastable glitches).
- **Low "Temperature" (End)**: Stable alignment â†’ Harmonic chords/drones (pure, resonant bliss).

For THX vibes:
- Start with clustered low frequencies (200-400 Hz rumble).
- Add glissando: Pitches rise and spread over octaves, building crescendo.
- Result: A cinematic swell, like engines revving to hyperspaceâ€”computation as symphony!

Hear it evolve in real-time: The sound *is* the solving process, not just the end. Scale to 30+ oscillators for epic density. Fun twist: Use as a sound design tool for music/FX!

## Installation and Requirements
- Python 3.8+ with NumPy, SciPy (pip install if needed).
- For Colab: No installâ€”just paste and run.
- Optional: Matplotlib for visualizing phases/energy.

## Usage
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ising-synth.git`
2. Run `ising_synth.py` (or paste into Colab).
3. Customize in code: Set N, couplings (K), frequencies, duration.
4. Output: `thx_ising_sound.wav` + console print of spins/energy.
5. Play the WAV: Hear the annealing!

Example snippet (full code in repo):
```python
# ... (simulation loop)
wavfile.write('thx_ising_sound.wav', fs, audio_data)
